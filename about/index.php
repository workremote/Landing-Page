            <p>I’m Harry Copeman, a product designer from Hull, England. I’m passionate about simplifying and improving the tools that humans interact with everyday. I sweat over pixels, typography and code. If I’m not at my desk, I’ll be riding my bike.<br><br>

            I’m lucky enough to be joining the amazing Facebook as a product designer, next year in London. Previous to this, I was the co-founder of a digital studio we called <a href="http://cyclestudios.co/" target="_blank">Cycle Studios</a>. Feel free to read my<a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/s/w38vg5upwhm74eq/Harry%20Copeman%20R%C3%A9sum%C3%A9.pdf?dl=0"> Résume</a>, and take a look at my <a href="/portfolio">work</a>.<br><br>

            Away from the screen I spend most of my time with my girlfriend Cara, or turning the gears on my bike through the countryside.<br><br>
